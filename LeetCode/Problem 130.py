# LeetCode: Problem 130
# Jonathan Kosasih

#Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
#
#A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
#
#Example:
#X X X X
#X O O X
#X X O X
#X O X X
#
#After running your function, the board should be:
#X X X X
#X X X X
#X X X X
#X O X X
#
#Explanation:
#Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border,
#which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
#Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
#Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
